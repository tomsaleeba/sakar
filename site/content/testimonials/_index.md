      We used Sakar Constructions for the renovation of our bathroom,
      laundry and living area. The attention to detail and desire to make
      the process as easy as possible by planning and communicating with
      us through the process was great. We would definitely recommend to
      anyone looking for a builder.

      We had Sakar Constructions as a specialist contractor on a project
      in Mannum Waters installing an Architectural Cladding Product and
      Timber Soffit System. Their attention to detail resulted in a
      successful project being delivered in an efficient manner with no
      compromise on quality. All members of the project team were pleased
      with the outcome and the attitude of the team through the duration
      of the project. A pleasure to work with.
